# SMS Backup & Restore - Desktop App

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository or download files
2. Run the application with command `gradle run`

*NOTE :*

This application has been written for self educational purposes. First I decided to learn JavaFX and when the first viable product was released for myself, then I decided to publish it on GitHub as an Open Source Software. I hope it will be useful for many users.
